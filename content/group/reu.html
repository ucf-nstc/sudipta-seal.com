				the opportunity to perform research projects alongside some of the world's
				foremost researchers for 10 weeks during the summer. The projects cover a
				range of topics in both engineering and science, including nanomaterials
				processing and characterization for the development of advanced technology
				materials - such as, sensors, carbon nanotubes, advanced
				nanocharacterization tool, materials processing and consolidation into
				components, miniaturized system. Project descriptions are summarized on the
				web site.

				Additionally, the REU participants will take specially designed short
				courses in Materials Science and Engineering, Nanotechnology and Advanced
				Nanoscale Characterization techniques. Other activities include weekly
				seminars, industrial visits, a course in Ethics in Research, and "round
				table" discussions between the REU participants and organizers.
			</p>

				REU participants must prepare and submit a final, detailed research report
				by the end of the summer program. In addition, REU participants must make a
				poster presentation on the results of their research at a closing REU
				symposium. For exceptional projects, students and their advisors are
				encouraged to submit technical papers and presentations to
