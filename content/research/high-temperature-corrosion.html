    		High temperature and high pressure (HT/HP) corrosion test setup has been designed with in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) capability. The cell can be operated at high pressure (20000 Psi) and high temperature (300 oF) in corrosive conditions, which provides important corrosion information of various steels and materials in HT/HP conditions useful to oil and gas industries.
