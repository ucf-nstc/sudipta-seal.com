$content = 'We are developing bulk nano structure coatings and nano composites with metal/CNT and ceramic matrices for functional coatings (corrosion, wear resistant, biomaterials). Recently, we are working on solution precursor plasma spray technique (SPPS) to produce rare earth based functional coatings (with or without dopings). As an example, we have developed doped cerium oxide thin coating for SOFC electrolyte and high temperature oxidation protection. Our research focused on coating development, microstructure structure and properties correlation using advanced material characterization tools. In house spray drying facility provides variety of spray dried composite powders to develop coatings at different level of porosities.';
