$content = 'Composite energetic materials play an important role in modern society, being used in airbags, oil and gas exploration, and most famously, as the propellant in solid rockets. Nanostructured energetic composites have orders of magnitude higher interfacial areas compared to traditional composites, and making the material from the “bottom up”, using molecular building blocks, gives us unprecedented control over the composite structure and composition. Combined, these advantages allow us to dramatically increase the energy density and performance of the material.';
