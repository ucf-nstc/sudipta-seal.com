    Dr. Seal’s outstanding research has developed surface engineered nanoscale transition metal and rare earth oxide ceramics for catalysis, energetics and nano-biomedicine.  He has developed scalable methods for template free nano oxide particles. He engineered nanoceria (3-5 nm) with switchable valence states with regeneration capability. Using a similar concept, his team developed spherical nano-ZrO2 ceramics without doping with metastable tetragonal crystal structure and explained the reduced activation energy for grain growth in nano-YSZ and other binary oxides.

  <h4>Discovery</h4>
  <p>
    Seal discovered the antioxidant properties of nanoceria by controlling defect chemistry. Featured in BBC news, New York Times and won prestigious grant from USA-NSF, NIH and DOD. Further, these nanostructures were developed into electrochemical peroxide regenerative sensors. Seal believes that the unique structure of nanoparticles, with respect to valence and oxygen defects, promotes, cell longevity by scavenging superoxide radicals produced in excess in cellular matrix and regenerate stem cells. Further protection was observed in rat retina and prevent the loss of vision, and other blinding diseases. (NATURE Nanotechnology. The research has led to the commercialization of the technology through creation of Startups NanoCe LLC. Currently received funding to work with FDA for pre-clinical trial.  This is a real impact from lab to bench side. The technology is further licensed to a startup BioCurity LLC and others to advance the commercial use of nanoceria in cancer therapy. Seal’s experimental work is supported by theoretical studies for a wide range of disciplines spanning from solar energy, energy harvesting and fundamental science of chemically active defect engineered oxide nanoceramics.

    His novel surface engineering of oxides/ceramics has led to the creation of a Zerocrete product, creation of nSolgel Startup. Recently they have developed a product named OOPS (Oil Optimized ceramic Particle Surface under a NSF RAPID grant (Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill) subsequently highlighted in National Geographic Article: (Seeking a Safer Future for Electricity’s Coal Ash Waste.

  <h4>Fundamental Science</h4>
  <p>
    Shown for the first time using Aberration Corrected High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy atom hopping in Nano cerium oxide and explain their unusual bio catalysis properties.  Various relevant patents are awarded in this area and led the development of a startup company NanoCe LLC (2012) for technology commercialization. Various Nanoceria formulations are also developed to prevent damage of the photoreceptor cells and other neurodegeneration, protection of healthy cells from radiation, patents are awarded and licensed

  <h4>Energetics Research</h4>
  <p>
    Seal’s group has recently developed Tailored Nano additives (surface modified ceramics) for Nanoenergetics.  A former Ph.D student from the group has created a startup Helicon Chemicals to further license the technology from UCF and in the last two yrs this startup has won various SBIR Phase I and II awards incorporating these nanomaterials in actual solid propellants (formulation) in real scenario testing environment in collaboration with US DOD. The main goal of this company to scale up these nano oxide energetic materials for further rocket fuel applications, which is currently underway.  Controlled nanoceramics (zirconia, YSZ), solgel derived oxides and chalcogenide glasses and their properties are documented in various high impact articles in NANO LETTERS, Progress in Materials Science and J American Ceramic Society, etc.  Based on above achievements, Dr. Seal has received the Central Florida Engineer of the year award and recently awarded the prestigious Schwartz Tech Award by Orlando Economic Development authority for translating research into technology commercialization.
