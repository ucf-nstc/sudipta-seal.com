$content = "We have revealed novel radiation sensitive properties of ceria nanoparticles. To understand this, group is working out atomistic simulation to understand the interaction of radiation induced changes in nanocrystalline cerium oxide. Various lattice models are created for cerium oxide and study the effect of radiation by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation study is underway in collaboration with the team at Pacific Northwest National Lab. (International partners: Crainfield University)";
