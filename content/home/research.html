	Dr. Sealâ€™s outstanding research has developed surface engineered nanoscale transition metal and rare earth oxide ceramics for catalysis, energetics and nano-biomedicine.  He has developed scalable methods for template free nano oxide particles. He engineered nanoceria (3-5 nm) with switchable valence states with regeneration capability. Using a similar concept, his team developed spherical nano-ZrO2 ceramics without doping with metastable tetragonal crystal structure and explained the reduced activation energy for grain growth in nano-YSZ and other binary oxides.
