				<h2>Dr.Seal's award from ASM recognized by EMSL, Pacific Northwest National Lab, WA</h2>
				<p><strong>From: </strong>Mahon, Darlene F   On Behalf Of Campbell, Allison A <br/>
				<strong>Sent:</strong> Friday, August 01, 2008 11:55 AM </p>
				<p><strong>Subject:</strong>  EMSL Director's Message for July 2008 </p>
				
				<p>It sure has been a busy month as we prepare for our upcoming review on September 8 - 10, the first review of its type to be conducted at EMSL since 2005. Results of the review will help BER determine if, during the past three years, we have functioned as a world-class DOE scientific user facility. This includes whether we have demonstrated high scientific productivity and impact, fostered a productive and satisfied user community, and achieved management and operational efficiency. Reviewers will consist of nationally recognized leaders in the areas of our
				science themes. We can also expect BER's new director, Anna Palmisano, to attend the review.</p>
				<p> Our staff and users have had some very good accomplishments this past month, and some excellent science has been published.  So let's move on to business.</p>
				<p><strong>CURRENT EVENTS</strong></p>
				<p> EMSL user <strong>Sudipta Seal</strong> (University of Central Florida) was elected to the 2008 Class of Fellows by the ASM International Board of Trustees. The honor of Fellow represents recognition of Seal's distinguished contributions in the field of materials science and engineering, and helps to develop a broadly based forum for technical and professional leaders to serve as advisors to the Society. He will be honored at the Convocation of Fellows to be held during the ASM Awards Dinner on Tuesday, October 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
